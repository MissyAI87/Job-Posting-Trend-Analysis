# Job Posting Trend Analysis

This project explores simulated job listing data to uncover the most frequently posted job titles in the tech industry. Using R and the `ggplot2` library, I created a bar chart visualizing the top 10 most common job titles based on 100 public job postings.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Analyze job title trends in a tech-focused dataset
- Identify which roles are in highest demand
- Demonstrate applied R skills using `dplyr` and `ggplot2`

## 🛠 Tools Used
- R (via Posit Cloud / RStudio)
- `dplyr` for data wrangling
- `ggplot2` for data visualization

## 📊 Key Insight
> Software Engineer, Data Analyst, and Business Analyst were among the most frequently listed roles, reflecting ongoing demand for technical and analytical talent.

## 📁 Files Included
- `Project2_Job_Trend_Analysis.csv` – The simulated dataset of job postings
- `Top_10_Job_Titles.png` – Final bar chart visual
- `Project2_Job_Trend_Analysis.pdf` – Full write-up including insights and chart

## ✅ Summary
The chart and accompanying analysis provide a clear snapshot of hiring demand across key tech positions. This project highlights both technical proficiency in R and the ability to derive and communicate meaningful insights from public data.
